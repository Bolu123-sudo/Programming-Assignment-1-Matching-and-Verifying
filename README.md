Task C:
The Gale-Shapley algorithm from the code was benchmarked with the sizes given in the example: 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512. The graph labeled "gmpartc.png" shows this relationship. This shows that the runtime increases as n also increases. This is O(n^2) because in one scenario, each hospital could propose to all students. (R was used for this graph, the csv and rmd are also attached: this is located in PartCExtras)

To run Part A:
The command: python3 src/galematching.py < tests/test.in is used. This means the file for Task A galematching.py is ran against the input in test.in. If different input file needs to be used then that second argument is altered.
